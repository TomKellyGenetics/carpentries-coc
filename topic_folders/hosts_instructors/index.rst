TEACHING AND HOSTING
##########################

Opportunities for certified instructors to teach Carpentries workshops are listed `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=0>`_.  Join the `instructors mailing list <https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors>`_ to be notified when new opportunities are posted.

Certified instructors are also encouraged to run workshops themselves. When organising a workshop, you 
have two options: a centrally-organised or self-organised workshop. 

One way to understand the distinction between centrally-organised and self-organised workshops is who 
is responsible for certain key workshop components: 

Centrally Organized Workshop
******************************

    * registration managed by The Carpentries Workshop Administration Team
    * instructor recruitment managed by The Carpentries Workshop Administration Team

Self-Organized Workshop
******************************

    * registration managed by local organizer
    * instructor recruitment managed by local organizer


.. note:: 
    **Recruitment of Instructors for Self-Organised workshops**

    If you are organising a Self-Organised workshop, there are resources for you to recruit Instructors, Supporting Instructors, and/or Helpers. Below are the channels you can use: 

    - Any local or group specific mailing list on `TopicBox <https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups>`_

    - Any local or group specific Slack channel

    We ask that you only use the resources listed above. Please **do not** use the following channels. Any recruitment messages used on these channels will be removed.

    * `Discuss list <https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss>`_ on TopicBox

    * `General Channel <https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C03LE48AY>`_ on Slack

    * `Instructors Channel <https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C08BVNU00>`_ on Slack


In both cases, the host site is expected to pay for instructor travel (if needed) and
cover local costs.  For a centrally organised workshop, there is a fee if the organiser
is not already a Carpentries member.

Note that you are free to charge what you choose for a workshop;
this is a perennial topic of discussion among the Carpentries community and there is
a good summary of points here: `Carpentries Blog on Charging for Workshops <https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/06/carpentries-workshops-fees/>`_.

In both cases (self- or centrally-organised), you can start the workshop
process by completing the `Carpentries workshop request form <https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/>`_ and 
then proceeding through the relevant checklists and list of tips below. 

For centrally organised workshops, the Regional Coordinator will guide the host and instructor(s) on following 
through on all these steps. A global team of Regional Coordinators support workshop activity and community building in regions around the world. `Read more <https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/>`_ about who they are and what they do.

For self organised workshops, the host and instructor are directly responsible for ensuring all the steps below are followed without support from the Regional Coordinator. If you are planning to self-organise a workshop, check out these `Tips for Organising Your First Carpentries Workshop <https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/10/organising-workshops/>`_.

Resources for Online Workshops
******************************

In the wake of COVID-19 in early 2020, The Carpentries community came together to share experiences, tips, and best practices for teaching online. This page lists all the resources developed and links to ongoing conversations by The Carpentries Core Team and community on different platforms.
